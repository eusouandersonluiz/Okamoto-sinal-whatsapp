// Closes the last untested volume panel: the Overview "comparativo de volume"
// (/metrics/private/volume-compare). It aligns the current period's daily
// received (inbound) DM volume, day-by-day, against the equivalent previous
// period (last N days vs the N days before). The series is keyed by `offset`
// (0..days-1) so the frontend can overlay two lines; for a given offset the
// previous point is the same calendar weekday shifted back exactly `days`.
//
// What can break silently here is the window/alignment math:
//   - current vs previous window boundaries (off-by-one or overlap),
//   - per-day pairing (the previous series must land on the SAME offset as the
//     current day it is being compared to, i.e. shifted by exactly `days`),
//   - DM-only (chat_type='private'), inbound-only and owner scoping,
//   - the zero-filled `days`-long series (missing days padded to 0/0).
//
// Timestamps are relative (now() - N days). The route buckets by date in the
// working timezone (America/Sao_Paulo, a fixed UTC-3 offset with no DST), so a
// message at now()-N days always falls on today_local - N — deterministic
// regardless of run time, except across an exact local-midnight tick (the same
// tolerance the sibling volume suite already accepts).
//
// The fixture targets a 7-day period:
//   current  date today-2 (offset 4): 5 inbound
//   current  date today-3 (offset 3): 3 inbound   -> current total 8
//   previous date today-9 (offset 4): 2 inbound   (today-2 shifted back 7)
//   previous date today-10 (offset 3): 4 inbound  (today-3 shifted back 7)
//                                                  -> previous total 6
// So offset 4 has current>previous and offset 3 has current<previous, proving
// the two series are paired per-offset and not transposed. The 4..8-day gap is
// deliberately empty so a narrowed window can exercise the empty-previous path
// without a boundary message drifting in.
