// Closes the last two Privado/Overview volume panels left untested:
//   - "Volume diário" (/metrics/private/volume): received/sent counts grouped by
//     day, DM only, owner-scoped, within the days window. A leak of group,
//     wrong-owner or out-of-window traffic would skew a day bucket or add one.
//   - "Resumo de volume" (/metrics/private/volume-summary): the period math —
//     current vs previous window (received only), avg/day and pctChange (with the
//     divide-by-zero / 100% / both-zero edge branches) plus the fixed 30-day
//     sparkline that ignores the selected period.
//
// One unified fixture set feeds both routes. Every message is private + owner
// unless explicitly marked as noise. Timestamps are relative (now() - N days) so
// the previous-window boundary math is deterministic regardless of run time: a
// message inserted at now()-N days is always strictly older than the query-time
// now()-N days bound, so it never straddles a window edge.
